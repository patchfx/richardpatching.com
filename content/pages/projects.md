GDDB is a superfast in-memory database designed for use in Godot.

This database aims to provide an easy frontend to an efficient in-memory database, that can be saved and reloaded.

GDDB saves a Godot dictionary and provides an interface to create, update, retrieve (either single results or all items matching the search) and destroy records.

GDDB started as a fork of [TinyDB](https://github.com/Owez/tinydb) with added functionality and a Godot wrapper.
